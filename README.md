* When a signed in user uploads a new book they'll have to select the book's category while also filling in authors name, adding a description, giving the tittle of the book and upload a photo for all to see.

* After the book is uploaded the user can then see their book on the home or index pages and can filter the listing by category

* Using JavaScript I was able to allow users to view and leave reviews on books while contributing to the book's overall popularity/star-count by giving a rating between 1 - 5 stars.
